# About the Norwegian UV-network, partners and data available.


## Overview
The repositories contain 11 doseproducts for 10 UV monitoring stations in Norway, for the period 1995/96 - 2017. The data are presented as hourly mean irradiances, daily-, monthly- and yearly integrated doses for real sky conditions, as well as cloudfree conditions. Gaps in measurements have been complemented with modelled values, based on cloud modification factors derived from synoptic cloud observations and pyranometer data, as well as derived from the [STRÅNG model] (http://strang.smhi.se/extraction/)
